This repository contains the final project code for CS4501. The device is a "magic wand" controlled by an Arduino Uno which upon being waved will take a
reading from an IR temperature sensor embedded in the tip of the wand. The wand is meant to take the temperature of a hot beverage and indicate to the user 
through vibration whether or not the beverage is too hot (over 120 degrees F), too cold (under 100 degrees F), or just right (between 100 and 120 degrees F).
